    <h3>ABOUT FRIENDS</h3>

	  <p class="pclass1">Pull up a couch and relax at Central Perk, where six Friends gather to talk about life and love. Friends tells the story of siblings Ross and Monica Geller,Chandler Bing, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribiani and Rachel Green.</p>
	
	<h3>THE CHARACTERS</h3>

	<p class="pclass1">At the beginning of the show, Monica Geller (played by Courtney Cox), is a chef who often changes jobs and boyfriends in her search for the perfect match. Her brother, Ross (David Schwimmer), is a paleontologist and divorcé (three times over by the end of the series) with a child. He has a long-standing crush on Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), a fashion-minded woman who grew up in a wealthy family but works (for a time) as a barista at Central Perk, a café and popular meeting spot for the group. Eventually she lands a job with Ralph Lauren. Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) is a ditsy masseuse and would-be musician with a quirky outlook on life. Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) is a mostly struggling actor and buffoon who often confides in Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), a well-off statistics and data analyst who has terrible luck with women and in time develops an eye for Monica. Throughout the series, the friends live together or apart in different combinations.</p>

	<p class="pclass1">As the show progressed, each character became a household name and each cast member a celebrity; they moved on to careers of varying success in motion pictures and television. The cast was renowned for its closeness and ensemble approach to their work on the series. The finale of Friends was watched by more than 52 million people.</p>
